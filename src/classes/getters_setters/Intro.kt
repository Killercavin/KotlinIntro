/**
 * Getters and setters let you, well, get and set property values
 * A getter’s sole purpose in life is to send back a return value, the value of whatever it is that
 * particular getter is supposed to be getting.
 * And a setter lives and breathes for the
 * chance to take an argument value, and use it to set the value of a property
 *
 * NOTE: Writing custom getters and setters lets you protect your property values, and
 * they give you more control over what values are returned or assigned

/**

/**
 * Removing direct access to a property’s value by wrapping it in getters and

/*
Adding a getter and setter to every property means that there’s a standard
way of accessing that property’s value. The getter handles any requests to
get the value, and the setter handles any requests to set it. So if you want to
change your mind about how these requests are implemented, you can do so
without breaking anybody else’s code.
