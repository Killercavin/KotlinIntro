/**
 * In Kotlin, a primary constructor is a special type of constructor that is declared as part of the class header, after the class name.
 *  It does not contain any code, it just initializes an instance of a class and its properties.
 *  To define a primary constructor, you should put class initialization arguments in the parentheses after the class name.
