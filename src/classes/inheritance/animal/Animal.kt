/*
We’re going to add some common properties and functions to an Animal
superclass so that they can be inherited by each of the animal subclasses. This
isn’t meant to be an exhaustive list, but it’s enough to bring the general
idea.

I’ll have four properties:
image: The file name representing an image of this animal.
food: The type of food this animal eats, such as meat or grass.
habitat: The animal’s primary habitat, such as woodland, savannah or water.
hunger : An Int representing the hunger level of the animal. It changes
depending on when (and how much) the animal eats.

And four functions:
makeNoise(): Lets the animal make a noise.
eat(): What the animal does when it encounters its preferred food source.
roam(): What the animal does when it’s not eating or sleeping.
sleep(): Makes the animal take a nap.
