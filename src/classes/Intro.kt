/**
 * Classes are templates that allow you to
 * create your own types of objects, and define their properties and functions.
 * Here, you’ll learn how to design and define classes, and how to use them to
 * create new types of objects.
 *
 * We'll meet constructors, setters, getters, initializer blocks and more

 * These properties represent an object’s state (the data), and each object of that type can have unique values. Example for a Dog class it has a name, weight, breed properties
 * The things an object can do are its functions. They determine an object’s behavior, and may use the object’s properties. For example a Dog class a member can bark, run
