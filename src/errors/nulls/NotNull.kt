/*
The not-null assertion operator, or !!, is different to the other methods for
dealing with nulls that weâ€™ve looked at over the past few pages. Instead of
making sure that your code is safe by handling any null values, the not-null
assertion operator deliberately throws a NullPointerException if something
turns out to be null.
